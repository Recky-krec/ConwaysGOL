# Conway's Game of Life

This is just a recreation of the arguably most famous cellular automaton: "Conway's Game of Life". I used C++ and SFML
to create this simulation.

## In-Game controls
- Space: Toggle drawing mode (pauses logic)
- C: Clears all the cells on the screen (set their state to "dead")
- G: Toggle grid

## What to come?
- Threads so it can be played with higher number of cells
- A generation counter
- Text message to advice which controls exist
